**Project Title:** Water Quality Parameter Evaluation and Trend Analysis
**Internship:** Week 1 Assignment ‚Äì *Shell-Edunet Skills4Future 4-week Internship Program*

---

## üìå Objective

This project analyzes water quality data to:

* Check if each parameter is within acceptable environmental limits
* Count and visualize parameter violations
* Classify overall water quality of each sample
* Identify monthly pollutant trends

## üìÅ Dataset

* **File:** `WaterQualityPrediction-Dataset.csv`
* **Rows:** 2861
* **Columns:** 11
* **Date Range:** 2000 to 2021
* **Note:** Rows with missing (null) values were removed during preprocessing.

### Key Parameters:

| Parameter | Description                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| NH‚ÇÑ       | Ammonium                        |
| BSK5      | Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD‚ÇÖ) |
| Suspended | Suspended Solids                |
| O‚ÇÇ        | Dissolved Oxygen                |
| NO‚ÇÉ       | Nitrate                         |
| NO‚ÇÇ       | Nitrite                         |
| SO‚ÇÑ       | Sulfate                         |
| PO‚ÇÑ       | Phosphate                       |
| Cl‚Åª       | Chloride                        |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning

* Parsed the `date` column
* Sorted entries chronologically
* **Dropped rows with null values**

### 2. Parameter Status Classification

Each parameter was compared against environmental limits:

| Parameter | Threshold Condition |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| NH‚ÇÑ       | < 0.5 mg/L          |
| BSK5      | < 3 mg/L            |
| Suspended | < 25 mg/L           |
| O‚ÇÇ        | > 5 mg/L            |
| NO‚ÇÉ       | < 10 mg/L           |
| NO‚ÇÇ       | < 0.1 mg/L          |
| SO‚ÇÑ       | < 250 mg/L          |
| PO‚ÇÑ       | < 0.1 mg/L          |
| Cl‚Åª       | < 250 mg/L          |

Each value was labeled as **"Acceptable"**, **"High"**, or **"Low"**.

### 3. Violation Count

* Counted how often each parameter exceeded its acceptable limit
* Bar chart visualized violations across all samples

### 4. Time-Series Trend Analysis

* Plotted concentration levels over time for each parameter
* Limit lines shown to highlight violations clearly

### 5. Water Quality Classification

Samples were classified based on total violations:

* **Good:** 0 violations
* **Moderate:** 1‚Äì2 violations
* **Poor:** 3 or more violations

### 6. Monthly Trend Analysis

* Monthly average values calculated for NH‚ÇÑ, BSK5, NO‚ÇÉ, and Cl‚Åª
* Line chart revealed seasonal variation in water quality

## üß† Future Extensions

* Use ML models to predict future water quality categories
* Detect anomalies using unsupervised learning
* Create an interactive dashboard using Plotly/Dash"# Shell-AICTE-Internship_Water-Quality-Prediction"
